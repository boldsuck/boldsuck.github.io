# Arbitration & Disputes

Haveno-reto is guarded by two arbitrators who can take decisions during a trade-dispute. Their role is to decide who's at fault, from information given by peers in the dispute chat.
Trades are secured by a 2/3 multisig, so an arbitrator can't publish a payout if it wasn't signed by the taker or the maker.

- Arbitrators can take up to 10 days to reply for cryptocurrency trades and 20 days for FIAT trades.
- Arbitrators wont take responsibility to refund any trades, they're already insured by security deposits.
